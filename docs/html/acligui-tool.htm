<h1>ACLI GUI script</h1>
<p>This tool is a helper to allow you to launch ACLI tabs against a shorthand list of IP addresses (or from a <i>-f</i> hosts file) without having to manually open a new tab in the ACLI window and <i>'open'</i> against each IP address.
At the same time the tabs will be named using the IP address (or the switch name, if this was provided in the <i>-f</i> hosts file).
This script has a GUI window which will launch if only partial information is provided on the command line (or always if the <i>-g</i> switch is set).</p>
<p>A shortcut for ACLI GUI is included in the Start / ACLI shortcuts menu:</p>

<p>The script can also be executed from any DOS box or from a ConsoleZ tab window:</p>
<pre>
	C:\>acligui -h
	acligui.pl version 1.12
	
	Usage:
	 acligui.pl [-gimnpstuw] [&lt;hostname/IP list&gt;]
	 acligui.pl [-gimnpstuw] -f &lt;hostfile&gt;
	
	 &lt;host/IP list&gt;   : List of hostnames or IP addresses
	                  : Note that valid IP lists can be written as: 192.168.10.1-10,40-45,51
	                  : IPv6 addresses are also supported: 2000:10::1-10 (decimal range 1-10)
	                  : 2000:20::01-10 (hex range 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f,10)
	                  : As well as IP:Port ranges: [&lt;hostname/IPv4/IPv6&gt;]:20000-20010
	 -f &lt;hostfile&gt;    : File containing a list of hostnames/IPs to connect to; valid lines:
	                  :   &lt;IP/hostname&gt;         [&lt;name-for-ACLI-tab&gt;] [-n|-t] [# Comments]
	                  :  [&lt;IP/hostname&gt;]:&lt;port&gt; [&lt;name-for-ACLI-tab&gt;] [-n|-t] [# Comments]
	                  : The -n or -t flags will be passed onto ACLI when connecting to that host
	 -g               : Show GUI even if host/IP and credentials provided
	 -h               : Help and usage (this output)
	 -i &lt;log-dir&gt;     : Path to use when logging to file
	 -m &lt;script&gt;      : Once connected execute script (if no path included will use @run search paths)
	 -n               : Launch terminals in transparent mode (no auto-detect & interact)
	 -p ssh|telnet    : Protocol to use; can be either SSH or Telnet (case insensitive)
	 -s &lt;sockets&gt;     : List of socket names for terminals to listen on
	 -t &lt;window-title&gt;: Sets the containing window title into which all connections will be opened
	 -u user[:&lt;pwd&gt;]  : Specify username[& password] to use
	 -w &lt;work-dir&gt;    : Working directory to use (including for &lt;hostfile&gt;)
 </pre>

<p>If for example you just execute ACLI GUI without any arguments this will launch the ACLI GUI Launcher window (for which you should also have a shortcut under Start / ACLI).
The window also allows you to set all the same arguments (IP address list, username, password, SSH or Telnet, working and logging directories, socket names and run script) that you can specify via the command line. And if you did specify some options via the command line, these will automatically appear as pre-populated once the window is opened.</p>

<img src="../images/acligui-empty.png" />

<p>The window has the following input dialogues:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Hostname or IP address List</b>: Can take a list of hostnames or IP addresses; in the case of IP addresses lists can be provided in compact form, e.g. 192.168.10.10-15,22,24</li>
	<li><b>Username</b>: Username which will be used to connect to all switches.</li>
	<li><b>Password</b>: Password which will be used to connect to all switches.</li>
	<li><b>Protocol</b>: Select either SSH or Telnet (default is SSH)</li>
	<li><b>Transparent mode</b>: If set, the ACLI instances will not go into Interactive mode, but will remain in Transparent mode.</li>
	<li><b>Containing Window</b>: If set, this will determine the title of the ACLI window where the ACLI sessions will be opened; if such a window is already open, the newly launched ACLI session tabs will appear in that window. If not set, the ACLI sessions will appear in a generic window named <i>"ACLI terminal launched sessions"</i>. This input box also has a pull-down, offering a history of values entered in this box.</li>
	<li><b>Working Directory</b>: Working directory to set on ACLI sessions once they are launched</li>
	<li><b>Logging Directory</b>: Logging directory to use on ACLI sessions once they are launched</li>
	<li><b>Listen Socket Names</b>: Optional list of socket names the launched ACLI sessions should listen to</li>
	<li><b>Run Script</b>: Optional run script to immediately execute against switch once the ACLI session is launched</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples..</p>

<p>You want to connect to a bunch of switches, for which the IP addresses are 192.168.10.10-15,22,24</p>
<pre>
	C:\>acligui 192.168.10.10-15,22,24
</pre>

<p>This will open up the ACLI GUI Launcher window, from where you can populate the username & password fields and then click on "Launch" which will then open 8 ACLI Tabs and connect to each of the switches. Note the shorthand way that IP addresses can be listed.</p>

<img src="../images/acligui-example.png" />

<p>Or you could already specify the username to use:</p>
<pre>
	C:\>acligui -u rwa 192.168.10.10-15,22,24
</pre>

<p>In this case the ACLI GUI Launcher window will still open, but now you only need to provide the password and then click "Launch"</p>

<img src="../images/acligui-example2.png" />

<p>If instead both username and password are provided on the command line:</p>
<pre>
	C:\>acligui -u rwa:rwa 192.168.10.10-15,22,24
</pre>

<p>In this case the ACLI GUI Launcher window will not open and you will directly get the desired Console Window with 8 ACLI Tabs each connected to the selected IPs.</p>

<img src="../images/acligui-tabs.png" />

<p>However, in this latter case you had to type the password in clear case on the command line, which may be undesirable.</p>
<p>If you wanted the above to still open the GUI window (so that logging & working directory can be set) then add the <i>-g</i> switch:</p>
<pre>
	C:\>acligui -g -u rwa:rwa 192.168.10.10-15,22,24
	
</pre>
<img src="../images/acligui-example3.png" />

<p>An alternative way to launch ACLI GUI, is via Start / Run, using the same command line syntax as above, but specifying <i>acligui.vbs</i> instead of just <i>acligui</i>:</p>
<pre>
	acligui.vbs -u rwa 192.168.10.10-15,22,24
</pre>

<p>And finally, if you wanted to share an ACLI shortcut to connect to a bunch of switches, you can do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create a batch file (.bat extension) containing:
	<pre>
	@echo off
	acligui.vbs -p ssh -u "&lt;username&gt[:&lt;password&gt]" -w "%CD%" -f %0 -t "Window Title"
	exit
	
	# List hosts below
	&lt;IP-1&gt;			&lt;Hostname-1&gt;
	&lt;IP-2&gt;			&lt;Hostname-2&gt;
	[&lt;IP-3&gt;]:&lt;Port-1&gt;	&lt;Hostname-3&gt;	[-n|-t] [# Comments]
	[&lt;IP-3&gt;]:&lt;Port-2&gt;	&lt;Hostname-3&gt;	[-n|-t] [# Comments]
	...
	</pre>
	</li>

	<li>Place the file in the directory you wish to be used as working directory once connected to switches</li>
	<li>Run the batch file directly, or make a shortcut to it and run that</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The batch file can execute acligui.vbs or acligui.bat; acligui.vbs is preferred as it does not open a CMD window in the background</li>
	<li>Placing double quotes around the credentials as shown, can be necessary in case of some special characters</li>
	<li>It is assumed that space character is not allowed in password</li>
	<li>Password special characters that can be used with acligui.vbs (no need to double quote): £$%*_+-=#/[]{}!;:@~\^&<>|</li>
	<li>Password special characters that will not work with acligui.vbs: "</li>
	<li>Password special characters that can be used with acligui.bat without double quotes: £$%*_+-=#/\\[]{}!;:@~\"</li>
	<li>Password special characters that can be used with acligui.bat with double quotes:    £$%*_+-=#/\[]{}!;:@~^&<>|</li>
	<li>Password special characters that must be double quoted when using acligui.bat: ^&<>|</li>
	<li>Password special characters that cannot be provided inside double quotes when using acligui.bat: "</li>
	<li>Password special characters that must be backslashed when not using double quotes with acligui.bat: \" \\</li>
	<li>If the password special characters become too complex, consider simply omitting the password from the batch file; when the batch file is run, it will open the fully populated acligui window, where the password can be manually entered, then the connections launched; this is also more secure as the password is not saved in any text file</li>
	<li>Always place double quotes around any value containing the space character, as seen above for "Window Title"</li>
	<li>The per entry optional <i>-t</i> or <i>-n</i> can be provided for terminal server connections where ACLI should not enter interactive mode with <i>(-n)</i> or should with <i>(-t)</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that when this tool spawns new ACLI terminal instances it will use the ACLI spawn file <i>acli.spawn</i>; see the manual entry for ACLI spawn file.</p>
